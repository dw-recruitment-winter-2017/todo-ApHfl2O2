# Democracy Works TODO project

To run this project in dev mode, the easiest thing to do is `lein run` from the command line.
It will start the backend server and figwheel, and the site should be available in a browser at
http://localhost:3000. You could also start a repl in the project and run `(dev)`. If you're
using the repl, you can stop both the server and figwheel with `(undev)`.

Thanks for your time!
